// Write this commission page where i will display all the user it will have a table that will show all the users and their slabs for 0-30 and 30-70 and 70-100 , the slab will be customizable by the admin for each user , these 0-30 , 30-70 and 70-100 are the count of sales with first month subscription and second month renewal . For ex : there is a partner who have 10% slab for 0-30 , 20% slab for 30-70 and 30% slab for 70-100 , he did 15 sales with first month subscription and later he turns 5 sales to second month renewal so he will get the commission as 10% of the subscription amount as per the slab for the first month and in the second month renewal the commission will depreciate 25% of the existing commission . The commission system must follow the same logic as the subscription system and when the user crosses the 0-30 slab the commission percentage will also increase as per the slab allowed by the admin .
